summary: Badge for project readme with code coverage stats
---

Badges in your project's readme can be a great way to give viewers a quick high-level
look at some of your project's key stats.

## Coverage

You can display the code coverage percentage for your project directly
on your project's readme page with Projektor.

The Markdown code to display the badge is available in a couple places in Projektor.
Click on the copy icon to copy the Markdown code to your clipboard to paste into your project's readme.

On a test report page:

![Test run coverage badge](/images/badge/test-run-coverage-badge.png "Test run coverage badge")

And on the coverage page for the repository:

![Repository coverage badge](/images/badge/repo-code-coverage-badge.png "Repository coverage badge")

Then paste the copied Markdown code into your project's Markdown readme file.
