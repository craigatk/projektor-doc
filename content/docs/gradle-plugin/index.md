summary: Gradle plugin for easily publishing Javascript results to Projektor
---

This Gradle plugin supports automatically gathering and publishing
the XML test results to the Projektor server. It listens to the
end of the build, gathers up all the XML results generated by
`Test` tasks in the build, then sends those to the Projektor server.

Example Projektor report from the plugin's build: https://projektorlive.herokuapp.com/tests/U6RAQSZHFAME

## Use plugin

To apply this plugin to your project:

```
plugins {
  id "dev.projektor.publish" version "5.0.1"
}
```

See https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/dev.projektor.publish for the latest version.

By default the plugin publishes results from all `Test` tasks in the project
when the build finishes.

The plugin also adds a `publishResults` task that lets you publish test
results from a build after it has executed (for example, if you didn't have auto-publish on)
This can be a good way to easily share a specific test failure with colleagues.

`./gradlew publishResults`

Note: If you have a multi-project build, please apply the plugin to the root project.

### Configure and apply via another plugin

In larger organizations it can be common to have base plugins that apply and configure a common set 
of plugins used by each project. To apply the `ProjektorPublishPlugin` this way from another plugin:

```groovy
dependencies {
  api "dev.projektor.publish:dev.projektor.publish.gradle.plugin:5.0.1"
}
```

```groovy
class MyPlugin implements Plugin<Project> {

    @Override
    void apply(Project project) {
        project.repositories {
            maven { url 'https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/' }
        }

        project.plugins.apply(ProjektorPublishPlugin)

        project.projektor {
            serverUrl = "https://myserver"
        }
    }
}
```

## Compatibility

| Plugin version | Server version | Java version |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| 1.0.0 - 1.0.2  | 1.0.0+         | 8+           |
| 1.0.3          | 1.0.6+         | 8+           |
| 2.0.0          | 2.0.0+         | 8+           |
| 3.0.0          | 2.0.0+         | 8+           |
| 4.0.0          | 2.0.0+         | 11+          |
| 5.0.0+         | 3.3.0+         | 11+          |

## Configuration

All the configuration of the plugin is inside the `projektor` block.
To use the plugin, first set the URL of the Projektor server:

```
projektor {
  serverUrl = "https://myserver"
}
```

If you want to disable the auto-publish of results at the end of the build:

```
projektor {
  serverUrl = "https://myserver"
  autoPublish = false
}
```

Or if you want to only publish results when the build fails,
set the `autoPublishOnFailureOnly` configuration value:

```
projektor {
  serverUrl = "https://myserver"
  autoPublishOnFailureOnly = true
}
```

There is also the option to not add the `publishResults` task:

```
projektor {
  serverUrl = "https://myserver"
  publishTaskEnabled = false
}
```

You can also include results from arbitrary directories in your build with the `additionalResultsDirs` configuration option:

```
projektor {
  serverUrl = "https://myserver"
  additionalResultsDirs = ['build/testResultsDir']
}
```

### Resiliency

The plugin includes configurable retry and timeout settings to help make publishing results
to the Projektor server more resilient against network hiccups:

```
projektor {
  serverUrl = "https://myserver"
  publishRetryMaxAttempts = 3
  publishRetryInterval = 100
  publishTimeout = 10_000
}
```

### All configuration options

| Parameter                 | Type             | Default  | Description                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |

| autoPublish               | `boolean`        | `true`   | Whether results are automatically published at the end of the build (by default results are only published if a test fails, which can be controlled using `autoPublishOnFailureOnly`) |
| autoPublishOnFailureOnly  | `boolean`        | `true`   | Whether results on automatically published at the end of the build only on failures |
| publishTaskEnabled        | `boolean`        | `true`   | Whether the `publishResults` task is added to support easily manually publishing results by running a task |
| publishToken              | `String`         | `null`   | Token to include in publish request to server (only needed when server has publish token set) |
| additionalResultsDirs     | `List<String>`   | `[]`     | Additional directories to include results from. Useful when you want to include results from a task that isn't `Test` type |
| attachments               | `List<FileTree>` | `[]`     | FileTrees to include as attachments to the test report and make available in the UI |
| compressionEnabled        | `boolean`        | `true`   | Whether to compress the test results with GZIP when sending them to the server |
| publishRetryMaxAttempts   | `int`            | `3`      | Max number of attempts when retrying publish of results to server |
| publishRetryInterval      | `long`           | `100`    | Amount to wait (in milliseconds) between retry attempts
| publishTimeout            | `long`           | `10_000` | Timeout (in milliseconds) to send results to the server |
