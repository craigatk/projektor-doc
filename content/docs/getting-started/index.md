summary: Getting started with Projektor test reports
---

To start publishing and viewing your test results with Projektor, first you'll need
to install the server. Please see the [server page](/docs/server/) for system requirements
and setup instructions.

Next, add one of the publishing plugins to your projects. Choose the most appropriate
plugin for your tech stack, either the [Gradle plugin](/docs/gradle-plugin) or
the [Javascript/Node script](/docs/node-script).

Now when you run tests you can view the full results in Projektor!
